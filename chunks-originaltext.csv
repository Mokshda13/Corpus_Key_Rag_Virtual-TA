A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,paul a gompers a note on valuation in private equity introduction valuation is the central concept in finance while investors believe that the process of valuation is difficult and fraught with error and assumptions in the context of private equity valuation in approached with rigor and care given the high leverage and substantial sums of investor capital at risk getting the valuation right is perhaps more critical than in any other setting without methods to assess value capital budgeting becomes impossible while elements of valuation remain an art finance theory and its implementation through valuation methodologies has important implications for private equity practice when reasonable assumptions are made the techniques discussed in this note can lead to better investment decisionmaking in whatever setting you work the margin for error in private equity however is much smaller than it is in other contexts maximizing the probability that the right decision is made is the goal of proper valuation methodologies valuation methodologies can be widely applied to analyze many of the decisions that a firm faces anything that might affect the size or the timing of a firms cash flow or changes its riskiness affects the firms value whether it is an

A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,for this reason it is usually useful to try to triangulate the discount rate of a target firm with a number of comparable companies in the search for a proper beta using a greater number of firms can average out the noise in the estimation of beta there is usually a tradeoff between picking many comparable firms or only a few the greater the number of comparables the greater the reduction in estimation error at the same time however you run the risk of including firms that are not truly comparable even trying to find comparables may prove troublesome one should try to find companies that are as close to the project or acquisition target as possible this might entail a detailed analysis of what the comparables actually do and the various weights these activities have within the firm finally the patterns of betas vary over time even for one particular company if one looks at the beta for an individual company the beta can change from year to year the systematic risk of the firm may vary the capital structure may vary or both this fact should provide some caution about using betas estimated over long time periods these
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,should try to find companies that are as close to the project or acquisition target as possible this might entail a detailed analysis of what the comparables actually do and the various weights these activities have within the firm finally the patterns of betas vary over time even for one particular company if one looks at the beta for an individual company the beta can change from year to year the systematic risk of the firm may vary the capital structure may vary or both this fact should provide some caution about using betas estimated over long time periods these points are not intended to dissuade you from using discounted cash flow methods for valuing firms and projects alternatives have little justification in most cases you should remember however that considerable care needs to be taken when applying the simple formulas think about which firms are closest to the firm being valued think about the underlying economics of the firm weighted average cost of capital wacc estimation using weighted average cost of capital starts with the same cash flows and asset betas with which ccf starts the difference between the two methods is where the tax advantages of debt comes

A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,the value of a firm that is expected to grow at a rate of g forever other multiples are sometimes used in practice for example ebitda revenue and net asset multiples are often utilized in practice in equation 14 the ebitda multiple is expressed as some function f that transforms ebitda into cash flows and then multiplies this cash flow times one plus the longrun growth rate and divides by the discount rate on assets minus the longrun growth rate 14 implicit in every multiple is the relationship between the chosen metric ebitda net income eps revenues etc and cash flows a cash flow multiple is typically better than other multiples because investors value the cash that a firm generates a person valuing a firm does not need to make an implicit assumption about how that cash is transformed into cash flows typically ebitda multiples will be more appropriate than net income eps or revenue multiples because ebtida is close to cash flow it is still necessary however to compare how much cash is generated for each dollar of ebitda or net income or revenue for example if two firms have the exact same revenues but one firm has twice
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,flows a cash flow multiple is typically better than other multiples because investors value the cash that a firm generates a person valuing a firm does not need to make an implicit assumption about how that cash is transformed into cash flows typically ebitda multiples will be more appropriate than net income eps or revenue multiples because ebtida is close to cash flow it is still necessary however to compare how much cash is generated for each dollar of ebitda or net income or revenue for example if two firms have the exact same revenues but one firm has twice the cash flow margin as the other the firm with the higher cash flow margin will have a higher value if one uses the revenue multiple from the firm that is more profitable to value the less profitable firm one would overvalue the less profitable firm a simple rule to follow when valuing a company using a multiples method is to use a multiple that is derived from a performance measure that is as close to cash flow as possible for example the relationship between revenues and cash flow is less tight than the one between net income and cash
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,the cash flow margin as the other the firm with the higher cash flow margin will have a higher value if one uses the revenue multiple from the firm that is more profitable to value the less profitable firm one would overvalue the less profitable firm a simple rule to follow when valuing a company using a multiples method is to use a multiple that is derived from a performance measure that is as close to cash flow as possible for example the relationship between revenues and cash flow is less tight than the one between net income and cash flow in other words net income is closer to cash flow and more related to cash flow than is revenue it is also important to benchmark the expected longrun growth and the discount rates of the comparable firms to those of the firm that is being valued equation 13 makes it clear that the higher the growth rate of the firm the higher the value of the multiple all else being equal therefore if the comparable firm that is chosen to value a particular firm is actually expected to grow faster than the firm to be valued the comparable company
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,flow in other words net income is closer to cash flow and more related to cash flow than is revenue it is also important to benchmark the expected longrun growth and the discount rates of the comparable firms to those of the firm that is being valued equation 13 makes it clear that the higher the growth rate of the firm the higher the value of the multiple all else being equal therefore if the comparable firm that is chosen to value a particular firm is actually expected to grow faster than the firm to be valued the comparable company method will overvalue the firm of interest in essence the multiple implies a future growth rate for the firm that is too high for this reason it is almost always preferable to do a comparable company valuation using forwardlooking multiples while trailing multiples ie multiples based upon past performance are sometimes used and may be the only multiples if projections are not available they are less precise than using forwardlooking multiples similarly the riskiness of the comparable firms and the firm to be valued need to be compared as equation 13 makes clear as the discount rate of a particular
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,method will overvalue the firm of interest in essence the multiple implies a future growth rate for the firm that is too high for this reason it is almost always preferable to do a comparable company valuation using forwardlooking multiples while trailing multiples ie multiples based upon past performance are sometimes used and may be the only multiples if projections are not available they are less precise than using forwardlooking multiples similarly the riskiness of the comparable firms and the firm to be valued need to be compared as equation 13 makes clear as the discount rate of a particular firm goes up the multiple that applies to that firm will be lower riskier streams of cash are worth less than less risky streams of cash if someone is trying to value a particular company by using a comparable firm but that comparable firm has a lower discount rate cost of capital than the firm to be valued any comparable company multiple would have to be reduced accordingly to compensate for the greater risk it should be easy to see from the above discussion that implicit in every multiple is a onestep discounted cash flow as such comparable company valuations
A Note on Valuation in Private Equity,firm goes up the multiple that applies to that firm will be lower riskier streams of cash are worth less than less risky streams of cash if someone is trying to value a particular company by using a comparable firm but that comparable firm has a lower discount rate cost of capital than the firm to be valued any comparable company multiple would have to be reduced accordingly to compensate for the greater risk it should be easy to see from the above discussion that implicit in every multiple is a onestep discounted cash flow as such comparable company valuations should typically be utilized as a check to other methods a wellspecified and thoughtful discounted cash flow analysis will typically provide more insights than a quick and dirty comparable companys valuation recommendation when should you use which method that depends upon the problem if you are estimating the value of a reasonably stable firm and you are only going to make one investment then the standard ccf or wacc is appropriate each will give you roughly the same answer private equity investors who have target fund returns almost universally employ an lbo valuation model finally the reasonableness of each of

Business Valuation_transcript,two industries that maybe have different types of market cap of capex and or maybe one is less mature than the other so those types of things so tv is total enterprise value and ebitda its actually even if you werent quite sure what it meant its actually in the financials of most companies that are publicly reported the concept is that if you know what the prevailing ratio number is maybe total enterprise value to ebitda and that ratio is 16 then you can begin to if you know the ebitda of the mystery company you can begin to get some kind of total enterprise value basically solving with that ratio okay so that is how these multiples work it is simply by taking a look at comparative companies and saying they should be for example in a case where we are trying to value a small company without economies of scale and we are making a comparison to large companies with economies of scale we may want to do that valuation that comparative valuation and then compare it to a small company and go ahead and say this is what the small company is worth then we would
Business Valuation_transcript,get some kind of total enterprise value basically solving with that ratio okay so that is how these multiples work it is simply by taking a look at comparative companies and saying they should be for example in a case where we are trying to value a small company without economies of scale and we are making a comparison to large companies with economies of scale we may want to do that valuation that comparative valuation and then compare it to a small company and go ahead and say this is what the small company is worth then we would make an adjustment to say okay this company does not have economies of scale how do we think that contributes to an adjustment okay so my ebitda wouldnt be quite as good in a new company without economies of scale so that means i would end up coming up with a lower total enterprise value than maybe it would be worth if i saw some path to scaling this and therefore would liberate some value that way so thats one way to think about the process here okay and im going to pick up from there with the next video
Business Valuation_transcript,make an adjustment to say okay this company does not have economies of scale how do we think that contributes to an adjustment okay so my ebitda wouldnt be quite as good in a new company without economies of scale so that means i would end up coming up with a lower total enterprise value than maybe it would be worth if i saw some path to scaling this and therefore would liberate some value that way so thats one way to think about the process here okay and im going to pick up from there with the next video now i think its right to ask the question of how you can actually use ratios to value businesses and the underlying premise the underlying premise actually is pretty interesting and thats that one of the things that at any point in time you find when you look across industries is that competitors in specific industries who follow similar strategies have similar cost structures and the reason for that is that it is often the underlying equipment that is the contributor to the efficiency of particular industries for example in chip and wafer processing theres only a finite number of
Business Valuation_transcript,now i think its right to ask the question of how you can actually use ratios to value businesses and the underlying premise the underlying premise actually is pretty interesting and thats that one of the things that at any point in time you find when you look across industries is that competitors in specific industries who follow similar strategies have similar cost structures and the reason for that is that it is often the underlying equipment that is the contributor to the efficiency of particular industries for example in chip and wafer processing theres only a finite number of companies that make the equipment to do chip and wafer fabrication so all the players in the industry whether it be nvidia intel amd they all buy equipment from lam research and companies like that and that whole thing tends to follow regardless of the industry so at any point in time you end up with firms if theyre following similar industries they end up having a very similar cost structure and so you can even look in the automotive industry and take a look at whats happened there and at different points in time what you would find is
Business Valuation_transcript,companies that make the equipment to do chip and wafer fabrication so all the players in the industry whether it be nvidia intel amd they all buy equipment from lam research and companies like that and that whole thing tends to follow regardless of the industry so at any point in time you end up with firms if theyre following similar industries they end up having a very similar cost structure and so you can even look in the automotive industry and take a look at whats happened there and at different points in time what you would find is that you compare gm honda toyota and you may find some differences at different periods but what would happen is that you would have a company like land rover get absorbed into another company and you have consolidation in the marketplace you know kia and hyundai converging to create an entity that is almost as big as ford and so if you take a look at those things what happens is you have a firm at a disadvantage like kia and hyundai because theyre a scale and they end up merging because theyre trying to compete and therefore they are
Business Valuation_transcript,that you compare gm honda toyota and you may find some differences at different periods but what would happen is that you would have a company like land rover get absorbed into another company and you have consolidation in the marketplace you know kia and hyundai converging to create an entity that is almost as big as ford and so if you take a look at those things what happens is you have a firm at a disadvantage like kia and hyundai because theyre a scale and they end up merging because theyre trying to compete and therefore they are now operating at similar scale as some of the other companies out there so somebody at a disadvantage from a cost structure standpoint would automatically follow the economics that are being demonstrated by some of the other firms out there you may have differences like in the airline industry with a company like comparing united airlines to southwest airlines they fundamentally have two different strategies they use two different types of assets and as such they have a different cost structure but if you take a look at competitors that follow similar strategies like united airlines delta airlines and american
Business Valuation_transcript,now operating at similar scale as some of the other companies out there so somebody at a disadvantage from a cost structure standpoint would automatically follow the economics that are being demonstrated by some of the other firms out there you may have differences like in the airline industry with a company like comparing united airlines to southwest airlines they fundamentally have two different strategies they use two different types of assets and as such they have a different cost structure but if you take a look at competitors that follow similar strategies like united airlines delta airlines and american airlines those are very similar similar scale and they use similar assets to generate economic prosperity for lack of a better word and because of that they do follow very similar cost structures so if you take a look at an example here as we talk about following the idea if you have a new grocery store how do you value the grocery store you can take a look at the cost structure between companies like kroger here and albertsons and what youd notice is there is a largescale difference between these two companies albertsons is significantly smaller than kroger
Business Valuation_transcript,airlines those are very similar similar scale and they use similar assets to generate economic prosperity for lack of a better word and because of that they do follow very similar cost structures so if you take a look at an example here as we talk about following the idea if you have a new grocery store how do you value the grocery store you can take a look at the cost structure between companies like kroger here and albertsons and what youd notice is there is a largescale difference between these two companies albertsons is significantly smaller than kroger but those are predominantly the two large public players in that industry right now and if you look at these numbers yeah some of these numbers are a little bit different but for land you know its 3 to 47 for buildings at 73 these ratios are 2 sales percent of sales over a threeyear average okay looking at this so you end up at 98 versus 11 in fixtures equivalent property plan equipment gross 253 versus 361 theres the biggest difference right there but the rest of numbers are fairly similar thats a demonstration of how these ratios actually
Business Valuation_transcript,but those are predominantly the two large public players in that industry right now and if you look at these numbers yeah some of these numbers are a little bit different but for land you know its 3 to 47 for buildings at 73 these ratios are 2 sales percent of sales over a threeyear average okay looking at this so you end up at 98 versus 11 in fixtures equivalent property plan equipment gross 253 versus 361 theres the biggest difference right there but the rest of numbers are fairly similar thats a demonstration of how these ratios actually kind of follow each other so we use that as supportive evidence to say that if i know what the total enterprise value to ebitda is in a particular industry then what i can do is i can plug in whatever number my new co is for ebitda and i can say okay if i have an idea of what that is then i can move along and figure out what the total enterprise value is by just solving you know one equation one unknown that gets pretty easy from an algebraic standpoint now i can run in some situations
Business Valuation_transcript,kind of follow each other so we use that as supportive evidence to say that if i know what the total enterprise value to ebitda is in a particular industry then what i can do is i can plug in whatever number my new co is for ebitda and i can say okay if i have an idea of what that is then i can move along and figure out what the total enterprise value is by just solving you know one equation one unknown that gets pretty easy from an algebraic standpoint now i can run in some situations where i maybe solve for what i think the ebitda should be if for whatever reason maybe theyre not profitable right now and you say that you know theres some idiosyncratic difference thats causing them not to be profitable maybe i solve for ebitda whatever scale and then i work on total enterprise value that way so i do this twostep kind of thing a little bit unfair but there is some justification for solving that way assuming youre using some form of ratio to get to the first step and the second one so you can do that and
Business Valuation_transcript,where i maybe solve for what i think the ebitda should be if for whatever reason maybe theyre not profitable right now and you say that you know theres some idiosyncratic difference thats causing them not to be profitable maybe i solve for ebitda whatever scale and then i work on total enterprise value that way so i do this twostep kind of thing a little bit unfair but there is some justification for solving that way assuming youre using some form of ratio to get to the first step and the second one so you can do that and so for our example how do we work through this thing in a smarter fashion so lets just power through this if you take a look at these two companies and this is following the example which is in the spreadsheet which is available to everybody what you have is kroger and albertsons again you take a look at the sales you notice theres a reasonable scale difference between the two well ignore outstanding shares and share value at the moment but we could take a look just from the financials that are in our old friend mergent or we
Business Valuation_transcript,so for our example how do we work through this thing in a smarter fashion so lets just power through this if you take a look at these two companies and this is following the example which is in the spreadsheet which is available to everybody what you have is kroger and albertsons again you take a look at the sales you notice theres a reasonable scale difference between the two well ignore outstanding shares and share value at the moment but we could take a look just from the financials that are in our old friend mergent or we could just go to some other public resource like yahoo finance or google finance and we could we could find out what these numbers are there is a number for total enterprise value in this link right here if you take a look at that link what you can do is copy that or go to stockanalysiscom and dig in that way but youll notice the variable here for symbol kr is a symbol for kroger so if you take a look at this link stockanalysiscom stocks dot kr thats the link to get that ratio that gives you total
Business Valuation_transcript,could just go to some other public resource like yahoo finance or google finance and we could we could find out what these numbers are there is a number for total enterprise value in this link right here if you take a look at that link what you can do is copy that or go to stockanalysiscom and dig in that way but youll notice the variable here for symbol kr is a symbol for kroger so if you take a look at this link stockanalysiscom stocks dot kr thats the link to get that ratio that gives you total enterprise value or you can do it this way you can take the long route if you dont have that for a particular company of interest and you can solve for market cap add a couple things back in and get the total enterprise value that way both numbers get you close they dont get you exact but they do get you close so whats that look like when we go to stockanalysiscom you have all this good information here i gave you that link just because the total valuation is one of the variables that they have right up
Business Valuation_transcript,enterprise value or you can do it this way you can take the long route if you dont have that for a particular company of interest and you can solve for market cap add a couple things back in and get the total enterprise value that way both numbers get you close they dont get you exact but they do get you close so whats that look like when we go to stockanalysiscom you have all this good information here i gave you that link just because the total valuation is one of the variables that they have right up top and this is the number that they show for whatever day youre doing the analysis so you can get some of that information that way so now im operating under the premise that i can take a known equation if i have total enterprise value and you can see the total enterprise value to sales you could have some kind of ratio there total enterprise value to ebitda just like we had in the use of private equity firms you could develop a ratio like that okay so tv to ebitda tv to ebit those two ones tv to
Business Valuation_transcript,top and this is the number that they show for whatever day youre doing the analysis so you can get some of that information that way so now im operating under the premise that i can take a known equation if i have total enterprise value and you can see the total enterprise value to sales you could have some kind of ratio there total enterprise value to ebitda just like we had in the use of private equity firms you could develop a ratio like that okay so tv to ebitda tv to ebit those two ones tv to sales you can come up with those numbers for the numbers that i showed you this is where you come up for total enterprise value to ebitda 051 its 983 you take a look and see the other ratios that are commonly used 039 to 031 yeah those are different but theyre not vastly different and so what do you do to that information what ive done to that information in order to work through our new company which is a grocery store with 2 million in sales to compare to a significantly larger company again were comparing it with
Business Valuation_transcript,sales you can come up with those numbers for the numbers that i showed you this is where you come up for total enterprise value to ebitda 051 its 983 you take a look and see the other ratios that are commonly used 039 to 031 yeah those are different but theyre not vastly different and so what do you do to that information what ive done to that information in order to work through our new company which is a grocery store with 2 million in sales to compare to a significantly larger company again were comparing it with 137 million is ive simply said okay whats the average of this now thats my tvd ebitda if i know what my ebitda is for the company then im able to directly come up with a valuation that way if i do it in a twostep process then what i can do is i can take my input field in my excel spreadsheet for valuation example and i can take a look at the ratios that ive just shown you from the previous sheet that ive been able to get from public sources and im simply able to solve for
Business Valuation_transcript,137 million is ive simply said okay whats the average of this now thats my tvd ebitda if i know what my ebitda is for the company then im able to directly come up with a valuation that way if i do it in a twostep process then what i can do is i can take my input field in my excel spreadsheet for valuation example and i can take a look at the ratios that ive just shown you from the previous sheet that ive been able to get from public sources and im simply able to solve for what ebitda and ebit would be solve for ebitda and ebit here these columns dont align up top but the ebitda for a company in the grocery store industry with a two million dollar number should be about 771 482 and then you solve for t total enterprise value that way that is if you do not have the ebit so the logic is slightly circular i have one variable im actually trying to infer the other ones from that so its a little bit unfair but the logic still holds in terms of how would you come up with
Business Valuation_transcript,what ebitda and ebit would be solve for ebitda and ebit here these columns dont align up top but the ebitda for a company in the grocery store industry with a two million dollar number should be about 771 482 and then you solve for t total enterprise value that way that is if you do not have the ebit so the logic is slightly circular i have one variable im actually trying to infer the other ones from that so its a little bit unfair but the logic still holds in terms of how would you come up with a comparative number that way so were cheating a little bit using twostep process but it does get you there as a mechanism the whole thing is to better help us understand how we get to a business valuation when we have a lot of unknowns and how do we deal with unknowns we make assumptions whats the underlying assumption here the underlying assumption is that businesses that are competing in the same industry are competing with the same resources and capabilities if theyre competing with the same resource capabilities then they should have very similar cost structures from those
Business Valuation_transcript,a comparative number that way so were cheating a little bit using twostep process but it does get you there as a mechanism the whole thing is to better help us understand how we get to a business valuation when we have a lot of unknowns and how do we deal with unknowns we make assumptions whats the underlying assumption here the underlying assumption is that businesses that are competing in the same industry are competing with the same resources and capabilities if theyre competing with the same resource capabilities then they should have very similar cost structures from those similar cost structures we can then derive what the valuation is from that thats how it is done in private equity and venture capital things like that so when you watch shark tank next time youll see people laugh about the valuation that the entrepreneurs are putting on their firm because theyre not using ratios often which are rational theyre saying their company is significantly better than they are so the way that robert urchavik for example would proceed is okay now tell me why your company valuation should be very different from the average public company out there thats
Business Valuation_transcript,similar cost structures we can then derive what the valuation is from that thats how it is done in private equity and venture capital things like that so when you watch shark tank next time youll see people laugh about the valuation that the entrepreneurs are putting on their firm because theyre not using ratios often which are rational theyre saying their company is significantly better than they are so the way that robert urchavik for example would proceed is okay now tell me why your company valuation should be very different from the average public company out there thats their goal to convince them why theyre the unicorn okay so that should get everybody all set for how to value businesses

Chevallier Strategic Thinking in Complex Problem Solving,to answer the question in one particular manner the second is to describe various alternatives or channels each of which could potentially answer the question use solution maps for the latter to lay out alternatives to solve a problem not to de scribe the sequence of steps to answer the key question in a specific way see figure 55 this may be challenging in my experience people tend to be more comfortable describing processes than identifying alternatives so chances are that sticking to identifying alterna tives will take a conscious effort validate the independence of branches one way to help you ensure that you are stay ing away from describing processes in your map is to periodically ensure that branches are independent because solution maps spell out alternatives each branch of the map must be independent from the others that is any one branch does not need the help of another to answer the question in particular you never have a time relation between any two that is you never have to follow one branch before following another that means that the ele ments in your map all are potential answers to your key question in figure 55 b using
Chevallier Strategic Thinking in Complex Problem Solving,you ensure that you are stay ing away from describing processes in your map is to periodically ensure that branches are independent because solution maps spell out alternatives each branch of the map must be independent from the others that is any one branch does not need the help of another to answer the question in particular you never have a time relation between any two that is you never have to follow one branch before following another that means that the ele ments in your map all are potential answers to your key question in figure 55 b using a rocket or swimming for instance both independently answer how can i go from nyc to london these solutions do not need any other elements to answer the question the same is not true of buy a ticket for instance in figure 55 a ignore desirability and feasibility for now at this stage we are not interested in the desirability and feasibility of elements as long as an element is a potential logical answer to the key question and it is not part of the voluntarilyleftoutanswers section of your process a channels alternatives b figure 55 use solution maps to

Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,i put in this video and slides because i can understand that if youre new to decision trees and hypotheses it can be confusing and i want to answer this question directly is it a way to combine decision trees and hypotheses so using them both together yes its the first approach we teach where we show you how to first build a decision tree prioritize the branches and then develop hypotheses for the study that is the way you combine it the other way is where you only work with hypotheses if youre just building out decision trees and not adding in hypotheses for the prioritized branches thats going to be incorrect youre just breaking out the drivers so you have two choices decision trees with hypotheses or just hypotheses now what ive done here is ive shown you a different way of building this out right but when i say different way its exactly what were going to be doing in the rest of the study just presented slightly different now lets assume that one of the questions we had to ask ourselves was can newco offer a service for which customers will pay newco being the merged
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,not adding in hypotheses for the prioritized branches thats going to be incorrect youre just breaking out the drivers so you have two choices decision trees with hypotheses or just hypotheses now what ive done here is ive shown you a different way of building this out right but when i say different way its exactly what were going to be doing in the rest of the study just presented slightly different now lets assume that one of the questions we had to ask ourselves was can newco offer a service for which customers will pay newco being the merged it division with three companies right well a way of breaking this down is we could say yes then if the question is yes newco can offer a service we have to ask ourselves can newco position itself to differentiate its products and services on these attributes if the answer is yes to that well then ask can newco create these attributes and meet financial criteria if the answer to yes is can the replacement channel overheads be reduced to the required level if the answer to that is yes can the shared overheads be reduced to the required level
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,it division with three companies right well a way of breaking this down is we could say yes then if the question is yes newco can offer a service we have to ask ourselves can newco position itself to differentiate its products and services on these attributes if the answer is yes to that well then ask can newco create these attributes and meet financial criteria if the answer to yes is can the replacement channel overheads be reduced to the required level if the answer to that is yes can the shared overheads be reduced to the required level and then well say yes relaunch brand leader strategy now the decision tree here is not important dont worry about this and think oh i need to understand this decision tree what does no mean how does yes mean its not important all i want to show you here is that there are multiple ways to build a decision tree right and depending on which branch you go down you have different parts available to the company if its a no to everything you have to exit it if its yes to everything well if its yes with a low
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,and then well say yes relaunch brand leader strategy now the decision tree here is not important dont worry about this and think oh i need to understand this decision tree what does no mean how does yes mean its not important all i want to show you here is that there are multiple ways to build a decision tree right and depending on which branch you go down you have different parts available to the company if its a no to everything you have to exit it if its yes to everything well if its yes with a low cost strategy you have to build a low cost strategy if its yes and where you can cut your overheads you build a brand leader strategy but the point im trying to make here is that once youve built your decision tree and youve broken it down to the furthest levels right you then have to ask yourself now lets take just one of those options that sit at the top here the one here lets just take this branch here and analyze it right so we are here so were analyzing this branch the next step once we have
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,cost strategy you have to build a low cost strategy if its yes and where you can cut your overheads you build a brand leader strategy but the point im trying to make here is that once youve built your decision tree and youve broken it down to the furthest levels right you then have to ask yourself now lets take just one of those options that sit at the top here the one here lets just take this branch here and analyze it right so we are here so were analyzing this branch the next step once we have this prioritized branch is to drive out the hypothesis and this is an hypothesis we have we say newco can capture significant market share due to superior processes and technology which leads to a cost and service advantage over competitors now weve got to ask ourselves what is the analysis we would need to do to prove that hypothesis now here ive listed the analysis a better way to do it is to draw out the analysis youd want to do so lets just take one for example cost and service metrics so you have each of your competitors and
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,this prioritized branch is to drive out the hypothesis and this is an hypothesis we have we say newco can capture significant market share due to superior processes and technology which leads to a cost and service advantage over competitors now weve got to ask ourselves what is the analysis we would need to do to prove that hypothesis now here ive listed the analysis a better way to do it is to draw out the analysis youd want to do so lets just take one for example cost and service metrics so you have each of your competitors and you have the cost and service metrics for each of them then what you do is so step one you have your hypothesis then you convert it to the analysis you need to do then you write it down and then you say okay where is the source for that whos responsible and by when now do you notice what weve done here its clear you have to combine hypotheses with decision trees but look at the value of this we start off with an objective function which youre now familiar with because youve done a lot of videos on
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,you have the cost and service metrics for each of them then what you do is so step one you have your hypothesis then you convert it to the analysis you need to do then you write it down and then you say okay where is the source for that whos responsible and by when now do you notice what weve done here its clear you have to combine hypotheses with decision trees but look at the value of this we start off with an objective function which youre now familiar with because youve done a lot of videos on that we build out a decision tree we break down the prioritized branches yeah i havent prioritized it well thats not true i used the yes and nos to prioritize which ones make sense and by answering yes and no i can determine which one needs to be prioritized example if i answered no to all of these this one here ends up being prioritized and from that prioritized branch i build the hypothesis now i dont have space here but i would have built the actual analysis converted that into text the source and the responsibility you see what
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,that we build out a decision tree we break down the prioritized branches yeah i havent prioritized it well thats not true i used the yes and nos to prioritize which ones make sense and by answering yes and no i can determine which one needs to be prioritized example if i answered no to all of these this one here ends up being prioritized and from that prioritized branch i build the hypothesis now i dont have space here but i would have built the actual analysis converted that into text the source and the responsibility you see what happens here were actually building a what what are we building were building a timeline or an activity plan for the study can you see what weve done can you see how weve done it this is how you go from the objective function to the decision tree to the hypotheses to the test for the hypotheses to the data you need to the source to the responsibility timing and deadlines and that gives you your timeline so using this process i can basically say to test this hypothesis this is the analysis i would need to do this is
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,happens here were actually building a what what are we building were building a timeline or an activity plan for the study can you see what weve done can you see how weve done it this is how you go from the objective function to the decision tree to the hypotheses to the test for the hypotheses to the data you need to the source to the responsibility timing and deadlines and that gives you your timeline so using this process i can basically say to test this hypothesis this is the analysis i would need to do this is the source this is the timing and mr manager this is when i will be done with it now the other lesson here is this previously we used postit notes little postit notes to prioritize different branches right do you remember that thats one way to prioritize it because of the way i designed the tree if its a tree without yes or no branches then yeah youre going to have to use some kind of postits or something like that to prioritize the different branches but and heres the big thing you can also design a decision tree with
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,the source this is the timing and mr manager this is when i will be done with it now the other lesson here is this previously we used postit notes little postit notes to prioritize different branches right do you remember that thats one way to prioritize it because of the way i designed the tree if its a tree without yes or no branches then yeah youre going to have to use some kind of postits or something like that to prioritize the different branches but and heres the big thing you can also design a decision tree with yes or no branches which by answering yes or no you end up prioritizing a branch i would say yes or no branches are tough ive done them a few times but i think they take a lot of iterations i certainly dont think it is something that you can do in a room with a group of people with just one sitting so because it requires iterations i would say only do it if you have a lot of time and youre not using it as a training program over a morning session if youre using it as a
Combining Decision Trees and Hypothesis_transcript,yes or no branches which by answering yes or no you end up prioritizing a branch i would say yes or no branches are tough ive done them a few times but i think they take a lot of iterations i certainly dont think it is something that you can do in a room with a group of people with just one sitting so because it requires iterations i would say only do it if you have a lot of time and youre not using it as a training program over a morning session if youre using it as a training program over a morning session use the postit notes approach without the yes or no branches if you are using yes or no branches you need a lot more time to do it but again to answer the original question is there a way to combine decision trees and hypotheses the answer is unequivocally yes

Consultoing Resume Writing_transcript,sure that you quantify these things as best you can with some third party show that you have people skills show that you can work in a team individual contributors are great individual contributors dont advance in a company and they certainly dont do really well in consulting firms because engineers are not good at dealing with customers heres one of the things about consulting firms that is a little bit more interesting the team is going to be more diverse when you get onsite users so you want to show your people skills as best you can they are looking for third party endorsements so to the best of your ability what you want to go through is take a look at whether or not youve shown lets say sat scores or lsat scores or if you have university awards where its only awarded to the top 1 or 5 or youve worked for a good name in a particular field thats important that shows something its meaningful and the issue with this is a little bit different than some of the things that people think in terms of resumes in a consulting firm what youre really looking to

Consultoing Resume Writing_transcript,do is clear the hurdle and so what they will do is they will give you certain points for scoring above a certain threshold on certain things if you are above a 35 gpa they may give you one point and if you are below it they give you no points if you omit your gpa because you think it may not be good enough you will get zero points so you have to consider the fact that each firm may have different scoring criteria but you will get zero points if you omit the information for sure and so err on inclusion because you will either make the cut or you will not and it will eventually come out quantify everything as best you can quantified results first and then state how you did it and above all i think that one of the most important things here is have somebody else take a look at it it is really challenging to edit your own writing its really challenging to take an objective view to your own writing because you have a thought process in your mind of what you meant during the articulation on paper of certain statements

Friga Assist_transcript,other adequately i used to have a paradigm when i worked on teams that i had to do my piece of the puzzle and i had to get that done it took some very good feedback to say look your piece is one piece but youve got to think beyond yours and think about the good of the team you cant have a player on a basketball team focused on just getting their statistics and their numbers they have to think about the overall team results so what are the rules of engagement whats the specific advice for teams in terms of assisting each other first leverage expertise second keep teammates accountable and thirdly provide timely feedback leveraging expertise theres no way any team thats assembled has all the knowledge necessary to do a successful project and would not want to take advantage of other knowledge thats either happened prior to that team being formed or within an organization or even outside an organization the advice is to be very careful about what kind of expertise could come into your team and add value at the right time leveraging expertise means understanding the skills and the abilities of a team
Friga Assist_transcript,terms of assisting each other first leverage expertise second keep teammates accountable and thirdly provide timely feedback leveraging expertise theres no way any team thats assembled has all the knowledge necessary to do a successful project and would not want to take advantage of other knowledge thats either happened prior to that team being formed or within an organization or even outside an organization the advice is to be very careful about what kind of expertise could come into your team and add value at the right time leveraging expertise means understanding the skills and the abilities of a team but then realizing where you have any gaps in terms of knowledge and knowing how to go out and get that well cover the collection of the data later but understanding that you need to leverage expertise beyond your team is a very important assumption the second is to keep teammates accountable weve talked before about evaluating and how you have to give assignments to people and have ownership on a project but its up to the team to hold accountability for the others on the team in terms of their performance so you should have agreed upon meetings and
Friga Assist_transcript,but then realizing where you have any gaps in terms of knowledge and knowing how to go out and get that well cover the collection of the data later but understanding that you need to leverage expertise beyond your team is a very important assumption the second is to keep teammates accountable weve talked before about evaluating and how you have to give assignments to people and have ownership on a project but its up to the team to hold accountability for the others on the team in terms of their performance so you should have agreed upon meetings and deliverables and then the team should be honest in giving feedback about where each person stands in terms of their accountability on those deliverables and finally how do you successfully give feedback feedback is a gift its a very important part of teams but there arent a lot of people who love to receive negative feedback the truth is though well never get better without receiving and changing based on feedback theres often a disconnect with how you think youre performing and what youre doing on a project and what others perceive that so it requires some regular feedback to
Friga Assist_transcript,deliverables and then the team should be honest in giving feedback about where each person stands in terms of their accountability on those deliverables and finally how do you successfully give feedback feedback is a gift its a very important part of teams but there arent a lot of people who love to receive negative feedback the truth is though well never get better without receiving and changing based on feedback theres often a disconnect with how you think youre performing and what youre doing on a project and what others perceive that so it requires some regular feedback to check in and make adjustments feedback is a really really critical success factor for teams in the book we talk a little bit about giving balanced feedback so you shouldnt just always give negative feedback to people thats never going to go well and you shouldnt just give positive feedback you should give balanced feedback you can get an observation of something thats going well and then you can also give something that can be improved at the right point in time one thing ive learned over time is you typically dont want to give feedback if someones not open
Friga Assist_transcript,check in and make adjustments feedback is a really really critical success factor for teams in the book we talk a little bit about giving balanced feedback so you shouldnt just always give negative feedback to people thats never going to go well and you shouldnt just give positive feedback you should give balanced feedback you can get an observation of something thats going well and then you can also give something that can be improved at the right point in time one thing ive learned over time is you typically dont want to give feedback if someones not open to receiving it so you have to make sure that its the right context to give the feedback that theyre open to hearing it even asking for it and then that feedback should be shared all in a positive nature the tone should be about improvement so those are the rules of engagements lets move to some more specific tactics of how to pull that off one tactic is to actually spend time working through the teammates and how youre going to solve the problems in a project you should match skill and will for your assignments so if a
